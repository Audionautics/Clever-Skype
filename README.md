Clever-Skype connects the chat output of Skype's chat window to the input of www.cleverbot.com.

In one of my english classes, we were tasked with creating marketing copy for a made up product. 
While I got busy photoshopping Aristotle's head being launched out of a cannon -- my product was a 
"logic bomb" -- A classmate came up with the idea of providing a service which had machines respond 
to all of the inane, pointless chatter we're bombarded with throughout the day. 

I thought such a thing wasn't so far fetched. And thus, Clever Skype was born.
